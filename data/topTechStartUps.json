The Forward Networks solution is designed to help network teams eliminate network outages and reduce time to remediate errors. Its platform enables engineers and operators to visualize and search complex networks, debug configuration problems, verify network-wide policy implementations, and predict network behavior prior to deploying changes. Forward Networks builds a software replica of an entire network to analyze its behavior. Using the network copy, the software traces, indexes, and stores the collected data, monitoring things like end-to-end behavior, verification of the network’s forwarding behavior and security posture, and close monitoring of configuration changes.",

   "about": "Today, on your smartphone you have an app store where you can find a dozen apps to have food delivered to your door, but we don’t have an app store where a large enterprise, like a bank, can find an app for income verification, or where an insurance company can find an app for processing claims. Every such application is custom built. We should wonder — why? The desktop computer is an important interface for business applications. Problem is, it wasn’t built to perform modern business operations. The problem lies in the operating system. Where Android and iOS were designed to allow applications to interact with one another, desktop computing simply wasn’t. This means that operations such as deal analysis and loan processing, which toggle between human data and computer data, can’t be performed without the assistance of a human being. It’s not only inefficient for businesses but utterly uninspiring for workers. Instabase is on a mission to fix that: to rethink the way we use apps and the way those apps work together to improve business processes and empower innovators to solve problems on a larger scale.

Between growing e-commerce and a strong economy, demand for trucking is on the rise. The trucking industry faces major problems: a shortage of drivers, difficult working conditions, and extremely high turnover. According to the American Trucking Association, the industry faced a shortage of 51,000 commercial truck drivers at the end of 2017. Long-haul trucking is primed for autonomous technology. Highway driving is more structured and predictable than urban driving. This means there are fewer decisions for drivers to make and a better fit for autonomous vehicles. We believe that autonomous trucks will play a major role in filling the gap while improving safety, enhancing truck driver quality of life, increasing efficiency, reducing congestion and emissions and creating jobs across the economy.",
